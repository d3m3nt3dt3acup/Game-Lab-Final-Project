# TicTacToe

Classic Tic Tac Toe game written in C++, utilizing the ncurses library for text-based graphics.

Place O's and X's on the board, try to make a line, prevent your opponent from doing the same.

Use WASD to move the cursor, and Enter to place O's and X's. After a win/lose or draw, you will be prompted to start another game with Y or exit with N.

To play the game, run the executable file in the TicTacToe folder.

To compile from source, install the ncurses library and compile ~~~TicTacToe.cpp~~~ with your choice of compiler. This game was built with the following command: ~~~g++ TicTacToe.cpp -o TicTacToe -lncursesw~~~
